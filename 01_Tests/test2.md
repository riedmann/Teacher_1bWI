# 🟦 JavaScript – Code Reading & Programming Tasks

---

## **1. What will be printed by the following code?**

```js
let sum = 0;

for (let i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {
  sum += i;
}

console.log(sum);
```

---

## **2. What will be printed by the following code?**

```js
let sum = 0;

for (let i = 1; i < 4; i++) {
  sum += 3;
}

console.log(sum);
```

---

## **3. What will be printed by the following code?**

```js
let x = 10;

if (x > 5 || x < 0) {
  console.log("High");
}
```

Explain **why** something is printed or why **nothing** is printed.

---

## **4. What will be printed by the following code?**

```js
let number = 7;

if (number % 2 == 1) {
  console.log("spitze");
} else {
  console.log("super");
}
```

---

## **5. What will be printed by the following code?**

```js
let marks = 60;

if (marks >= 90) {
  console.log("A");
} else if (marks >= 80) {
  console.log("B");
} else if (marks >= 70) {
  console.log("C");
} else if (marks >= 60) {
  console.log("D");
} else {
  console.log("F");
}
```

---

## **6. Write a loop**

Write a `for` loop that **calculates the sum of all numbers between 5(exclusive) and 10 (inclusive)** and prints the result.

---

## **7. Finish the code (if / else if / else)**

Write an `if / else if / else` statement that compares the **age difference** between two people:

* If the age difference is **greater than 40 years**, print `"Oma"`
* If the age difference is **between 20 (include) and 39 (include) years**, print `"Mama"`
* Otherwise, print `"Schwester"`

```js
let age1 = 30;
let age2 = 90;

// your code here
```
