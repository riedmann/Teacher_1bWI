# Assignment: HTTP Protocol & Session Management

## 1. Overview
HTTP is a **stateless** protocol, meaning each request is independent and the server does not "remember" the client by default. To create a personalized experience (like a shopping cart or a user login), we must implement **Session Management**.

## 2. The Challenge
Your task is to explain the lifecycle of an HTTP session. You must describe how a server identifies a returning client and maintains state across multiple requests.
